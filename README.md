# 2019nCoV_DBScan
1.Detect 2019nCoV sample's variants using consensus fasta

2.Calculate the similarity between the query seq and 2019nCoV database sequences

3.Based on the similarity score, giving the top20 most similarity sequence in 2019nCoV database

4.Do some qc for query seq, such as query seq's length/N base number/N base percentage

5.Give summary information for query sequence, such as: 1)variants num; 2)snp num; 3)insertion num; 4)deletion num;
